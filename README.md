# 👋 Hi, I'm Glyn Johnston

🎯 .NET Developer | 💡 Clean Code Advocate 

I'm a software developer with a focus on C# and .NET, passionate about writing clean, maintainable, and well-structured code. Most of my commercial experience in development has been on closed systems, so I have created a small portfolio of projects to demonstrate my skills.
